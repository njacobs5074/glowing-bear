# Play
Activator template for Play Framework and the Slick database access library
This template helps building a classic web app or a JSON API

For a more complex example, see the [computer database sample](https://github.com/playframework/play-slick/tree/master/samples/computer-database)

# sbt-release
By default we publish to the `$HOME/tmp/releases`.  To play with this feature,
run either `sbt release` to generate a new official release or `sbt publish` to publish a snapshot.  NB: `sbt publishLocal` will generate a snapshot release.
